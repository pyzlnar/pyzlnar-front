= Pyzlnar Front
[Front end for pyzlnar.com]
:toc:
:showtitle:

== Introduction

This the front end repo for link:https://pyzlnar.com[pyzlnar.com] +
Currently the front end is running in React and Redux, written in ES6 using
babel as a transpiler, and using inuit for the CSS.

This indeed sounds very fancy, but the truth is that I'm not exactly a front end
guy, so chaces are that you will find stuff that is very very dirty. Hell, even
the design is kinda ugly.

== Installation

=== Requirements

You will need the following installed to be able to run the front end:

* git +
  Should go without saying. Get yourself git
  link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[installed].
* node.js v5.4.1+ +
  I recommend you install it via link:https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm].
* yarn +
  Installation instructions can be found
  link:https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install[here].
* pyzlnar-back +
  You'll need the back end up and running to be able to get the API responses. +

=== Source Code

Clone the repo into your machine, and then change to the directory before you
run anything else.

[source, bash]
----
# Create a root directory first if you haven't already.
# The directory structure is not needed, but I like working this way.
$ mkdir pyzlnar

# Clone the repo into front
$ git clone https://github.com/pyzlnar/pyzlnar-front.git pyzlnar/front

# Change to front directory
$ cd pyzlnar/front
----

With the back repo, directories will look like this.

[source, bash]
----
$ tree pyzlnar/ -L 1
pyzlnar/
├── back
└── front
----

=== Dependencies

Now you need to install all the dependencies. Fortunately this is done quite
easily with the help of yarn.

[source, bash]
----
$ yarn install

# Or if you're feeling fancy, simply
$ yarn
----

== Running

* Development +
  Runs the server in development mode. Everything will be non obfuscated, and
  changes will cause an automatic reload. Default port is `8080`.

[source, bash]
----
# http://localhost:8080
$ yarn dev
----

* Development Build +
  Runs the server in a build mode for development. This emulates production, but
  also serves the files. JS and CSS will be compiled and obfuscated. Hot reload
  will also be available but it's obviously slower. Also uses port `8080`.

[source, bash]
----
# http://localhost:8080
$ yarn dev:build
----

* Production Build +
  Builds all the assets, obfuscating them. Also copies all the images into the
  public folder. Since this just compiles files and expects something else to
  serve them (nginx) it doesn't need a port. It takes a couple of seconds so be
  patient.

[source, bash]
----
$ yarn build
----

== Tests

Running the tests is very easy! You just need to do:

[source, bash]
----
$ yarn test
----

And enjoy the nice output! Have that sense of relief that you have not killed
anything.

Fair warning though, I don't have component tests as of yet.
It feels weird to test them when they're super volatile, but maybe that's
exactly why I should. At some point I'll probably add some minimalistic tests
to ensure that at least I don't get weird errors.

== TODO
